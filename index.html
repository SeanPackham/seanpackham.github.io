        I'm passionate about playing, designing and making games.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time I tinker on my side project <strong>Cardturn</strong>,
        <em>a tool to rapidly design and prototype card games.</em>

      <h2>My story</h2>

      <p>
        My passion for games started with the NES and took off when I discovered Pokemon and Magic: The Gathering. To this day, I still love the excitement of brewing decks and pulling off combos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing up, I fondly remember marathon board game sessions that made days flyby, and the neighbourhood huddled around a computer taking turns to play games.
      </p>
      <p>
        My uncle networked their house with the neighbours and we played roleplaying and strategy video games until the images burned into our retinas. To this day, the neighbourhood still gets together online to play the classics and discover new favourites.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned to code in high school to make games. I went on to study computer science, game development and AI at university.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've worked in the games industry with AAA and indie studios, lectured game design and development, and hosted and participated in many game jams.
      </p>

      <h2>Why I'm building Cardturn</h2>

      <p>
        I love playing games, designing systems, creating tools and doing game jams with old and new friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm creating Cardturn to empower game designers and developers to quickly and easily design and prototype card games.
      </p>
