      <h1>Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sean</h1>

      <p>
        I'm building <strong>CardTurn</strong>,
        <em>the only tool you need to create tabletop and turn-based games.</em>
      </p>

      <h2>My story</h2>

      <p>
        My passion for card games started when I discovered Pokemon and Magic: The Gathering. To this day, I still love the excitement of brewing decks and pulling off combos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing up, I fondly remember marathon board game sessions that made days flyby, and the neighbourhood huddled around a computer taking turns to play Might and Magic.
      </p>
      <p>
        My uncle networked their house with the neighbours and we played roleplaying and strategy video games until the images burned into our retinas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I'm still hooked to RPGs, I keep coming back to MTG (thank you Arena) and have discovered new digital favourites like Slay the Spire and Into the Breach.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned to code in high school to work out how to make games. I went on to study computer science, game development and AI at university.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many years later and I've worked in the games industry with AAA and indie studios, lectured game design and helped grow fast-paced startups across the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I'm not done yet...
      </p>

      <h2>Why I'm building CardTurn</h2>

      <p>
        I'm channelling my passion for games with everything I've learnt into building CardTurn.
      </p>
      <p>
        CardTurn will empower game designers and developers to quickly and easily design, develop, play and share card, board and turn-based games.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to inspire new generations of game makers and players to create their own adventures.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to accelerate industry experts to expand their creativity and output.
      </p>
